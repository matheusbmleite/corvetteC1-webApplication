		<h1>The Chevrolet Corvette</h1>
		<h2>America's Sensational Sports Car!</h2>
		<p>Creating a sensation everywhere! The new Chevrolet Corvette has been received with a storm of enthusiastic approval wherever it has been shown.</p>
		<p>The racy new Corvette sets a new style for a new field-the American sports car. Barely 33 inches high at door level, it has broad low lines and a road-hugging center of gravity. The smoothly contoured glass-fiber body is surrounded by a rakish back-swept windshield. A smart fabric top folds into a concealed compartment in the long read deck just ahead of a commodious luggage locker. The spacious two-place cockpit is beautifully styled and finished throughout in typical sports car tradition.</p>
		<p>As for performance... it's thrilling. A 160 h.p., extra-high-compression <q>Blue-Flame</q> engine is teamed with the new Powerglide automatic transmittion, a combination that makes the Corvette an outstanding performer on any road, under any condition.</p> 
		<p>This is a car of which we can say with complete sincerity, <q>You have to see it to believe it.</q> The Corvette is scheduled for limited prodution during the last half of 1953. <a href="learn-more.html" title="learn more">Learn more</a></p>
